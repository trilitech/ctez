        "question": "Who is behind ctez?",
        "answer": "The smart contracts are written by Tezos Co-Founder Arthur Breitman, and implemented by PK Labs."
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "question": "How is it different from using tez?",
        "answer": "Ctez can be used directly in smart contracts across Tezos DeFi without having to worry about the thorny question: Who’s baking? This solves the issue of large amounts of tez being pooled and locked in smart contracts which may therefore effectively be excluded from Tezos governance."
      },
      {
        "id": 3,
        "question": "That’s great! How can I get started using it?",
        "answer": "By opening up your own personal oven on https://ctez.app"
      },
      {
        "id": 4,
        "question": "What’s a personal oven?",
        "answer": "Where you can mint, burn, delegate, and modify depositors for ctez and tez."
      },

        "id": 5,
        "question": "Can I create more than one oven?",
        "answer": "Yes, you can!"
      },
      {
        "id": 6,
        "question": "Why would someone create more than one oven?",
        "answer": "In case that you would like to whitelist an oven, or create one that can be used by multiple addresses."
      },
      {
        "id": 7,
        "question": "What is liquidity incentives?",
        "answer": "Liquidity incentives, also known as subsidies, are fees for using outstanding ctez, charged to oven owners in favor of liquidity providers who supply liquidity to the protocol's built-in DEX. Subsidies cannot exceed 1% per year and are only charged when the DEX has low liquidity. These subsidies are ctez tokens, which are automatically deducted and transferred to the DEX address. As a result, oven owners may notice that the outstanding ctez balance in their oven periodically increases slightly."

  "faq2":
  [
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "How is the value of ctez determined?",
      "answer": "Algorithmically! More information about the formula and the ‘drift’ can be found in this FAQ."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "I’ve read something about ‘liquidation’ being possible, what does that mean?",
      "answer": "In the event that you under collateralized by 6.7%, your oven can be closed and anyone can grab the collateral by sending the outstanding ctez -or fraction thereof- to the vault."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "If that happens, is there a fee that must be paid?",
      "answer": "Yes! There is a 1/31 penalty for liquidation."
    },
    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "Can I use ctez in any Dapp that uses Tezos?",
      "answer": "Yes, but the developers behind the Dapp must update their smart contracts to work with it. In principle, any token/XTZ pair can be replaced by any token/ctez pair."
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "Is there a locking period for ctez?",
      "answer": "Nope, you can mint and redeem whenever you want!"
    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "question": "What are the fees for minting and redeeming ctez?",
      "answer": "None, except for transaction fees (gas) and subsidies fee (see the ‘Liquidity incentives’ article in this FAQ)."
    },
    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "What is the ‘drift’?",
      "answer": "It is a system-wide parameter that varies over time. The drift helps to maintain a stable tez:ctez conversion rate. Swapping tez for ctez or vice versa, adding / removing liquidity adjust the drift and target factor. Each time the Ctez main contract is called, the drift, and the target factor for ctez, are adjusted."
